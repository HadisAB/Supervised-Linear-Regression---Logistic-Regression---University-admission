# Supervised-Linear-Regression---Logistic-Regression---University-admission
In this short project we are going to apply Logistic Regression model with full mathematical operations without using scikit learn.

## Project details
Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams.

<ul>
<li>You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression.</li>
<li>For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.</li>
<li>The task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams.</li>
<li>y=1 means the student was admitted.</li>
<li>y=0 means the student was not admitted.</li>
</ul>


## Getting Started

1. Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and install it.
2. Below packages need to be installed in your environment, too.

> [numpy](https://numpy.org/)<br/>
> [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/) 

## Result
The blue line clarifies the decision boundary earned by logistic Regression and 92% accuracy.<br/>
